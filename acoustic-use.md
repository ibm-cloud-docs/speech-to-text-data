# Using a custom acoustic model
{: #acousticUse}

Once you create and train your custom acoustic model, you can use it in speech recognition requests. You use the `acoustic_customization_id` query parameter to specify the custom acoustic model for a request, as shown in the following examples. You must issue the request with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the model.

You can also specify a custom language model to be used with the request, which can increase transcription accuracy. For more information, see [Using custom language and custom acoustic models during speech recognition](/docs/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-useBoth#useBothRecognize).

You can create multiple custom acoustic models for the same or different domains or environments. However, you can specify only one custom acoustic model at a time with the `acoustic_customization_id` parameter.

## Examples of using a custom acoustic model
{: #acousticUse-examples}

-   For the [WebSocket interface](/docs/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-websockets), use the `/v1/recognize` method. The specified custom model is used for all requests that are sent over the connection.

    ```javascript
    var my_access_token = '{token}';
    var wsURI = '{ws_url}/v1/recognize'
      + '?access_token=' + my_access_token
      + '&model=en-US_NarrowbandModel'
      + '&acoustic_customization_id={customization_id}';
    var websocket = new WebSocket(wsURI);
    ```
    {: codeblock}

-   For the [synchronous HTTP interface](/docs/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-http), use the `POST /v1/recognize` method. The specified custom model is used for that request.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
    --header "Content-Type: audio/flac" \
    --data-binary @audio-file1.flac \
    "{url}/v1/recognize?acoustic_customization_id={customization_id}"
    ```
    {: pre}

-   For the [asynchronous HTTP interface](/docs/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-async), use the `POST /v1/recognitions` method. The specified custom model is used for that request.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
    --header "Content-Type: audio/flac" \
    --data-binary @audio-file.flac \
    "{url}/v1/recognitions?acoustic_customization_id={customization_id}"
    ```
    {: pre}

You can omit the language model from the request if the custom model is based on the default model, `en-US_BroadbandModel`. Otherwise, you must use the `model` parameter to specify the base model, as shown for the WebSocket example. A custom model can be used only with the base model for which it is created.

## Troubleshooting the use of custom acoustic models
{: #acousticTroubleshoot}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

If you apply a custom acoustic model to speech recognition but find that the quality of speech recognition does not improve, check for the following possible problems:

-   Make sure that you are correctly passing the customization ID to the recognition request as shown in the previous examples.
-   Make sure that the status of the custom model is `available`, meaning that it is fully trained and ready to use. For more information, see [Listing custom acoustic models](/docs/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-manageAcousticModels#listModels-acoustic).
