# Output features
{: #output}

{{site.data.keyword.speechtotextdatafull}} for {{site.data.keyword.icp4dfull}} offers the following features to indicate the information that the service is to include in its transcription results for a speech recognition request. All output parameters are optional.
{: shortdesc}

-   For examples of simple speech recognition requests for each of the service's interfaces, see [Making a recognition request](/docs/services/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-basic-request).
-   For examples and descriptions of speech recognition responses, see [Understanding recognition results](/docs/services/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-basic-response). The service returns all JSON response content in the UTF-8 character set.
-   For an alphabetized list of all available speech recognition parameters, including their status (generally available or beta), supported languages, and supported interfaces, see the [Parameter summary](/docs/services/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-summary).

## Speaker labels
{: #speaker_labels}

The speaker labels feature is beta functionality that is available for US English, Japanese, and Spanish (both broadband and narrowband models) and UK English (narrowband model only).
{: note}

Speaker labels identify which individuals spoke which words in a multi-participant exchange. (Labeling who spoke and when is sometimes referred to as *speaker diarization*.) You can use the information to develop a person-by-person transcript of an audio stream, such as contact to a call center. Or you can use it to animate an exchange with a conversational robot or avatar. For best performance, use audio that is at least a minute long.

Speaker labels are optimized for two-speaker scenarios. They work best for telephone conversations that involve two people in an extended exchange. They can handle up to six speakers, but more than two speakers can result in variable performance. Two-person exchanges are typically conducted over narrowband media, but you can use speaker labels with both narrowband and broadband models.

To use the feature, you set the `speaker_labels` parameter to `true` for a recognition request; the parameter is `false` by default. The service identifies speakers by individual words of the audio. It relies on a word's start and end time to identify its speaker. Therefore, enabling speaker labels also forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true` (see [Word timestamps](/docs/services/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-output#word_timestamps)).

### Speaker labels example
{: #speakerLabelsExample}

The following example request shows a response that includes speaker labels. The numeric values that are associated with each element of the `timestamps` array are the start and end times of the word in the audio.

{: codeblock}

The `transcript` field shows the final transcript of the audio, which lists the words as they were spoken by all participants. By comparing and synchronizing the speaker labels with the timestamps, you can reassemble the conversation as it occurred.

</table>

The results clearly indicate how this two-person exchange began:

-   **Speaker 2** - "Hello?"
-   **Speaker 1** - "Yeah?"
-   **Speaker 2** - "Yeah, how's Billy?"

In the example, the `confidence` fields indicate the service's confidence in its identification of the speakers. The `final` field has a value of `false` for each word. This value indicates that the service is still processing the audio. The service might change its identification of the speaker or its confidence for individual words before it is done.

### Speaker IDs for speaker labels
{: #speakerLabelsIDs}

The example also illustrates an interesting aspect of speaker IDs. In the `speaker` fields, the first speaker has an ID of `2` and the second has an ID of `1`. The service develops a better understanding of the speaker patterns as it processes the audio. Therefore, it can change speaker IDs for individual words, and can also add and remove speakers, until it generates its final results.

As a result, speaker IDs might not be sequential, contiguous, or ordered. For instance, IDs typically start at `0`, but in the previous example, the earliest ID is `1`. The service likely omitted an earlier word assignment for speaker `0` based on further analysis of the audio. Omissions can happen for later speakers, as well. Omissions can result in gaps in the numbering and produce results for two speakers who are labeled, for example, `0` and `2`. Another consideration is that speakers can leave a conversation. So a participant who contributes only to the early stages of a conversation might not appear in later results.

### Requesting interim results for speaker labels
{: #speakerLabelsInterim}

With the WebSocket interface, you can request interim results as well as speaker labels (see [Interim results](/docs/services/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-output#interim)). Final results are generally better than interim results. But interim results can help identify the evolution of a transcript and the assignment of speaker labels. Interim results can indicate where transient speakers and IDs appeared or disappeared. However, the service can reuse the IDs of speakers that it initially identifies and later reconsiders and omits. Therefore, an ID might refer to two different speakers in interim and final results.

When you request both interim results and speaker labels, final results for long audio streams might arrive well after initial interim results are returned. It is also possible for some interim results to include only a `speaker_labels` field without the `results` and `result_index` fields. If you do not request interim results, the service returns final results that include `results` and `result_index` fields and a single `speaker_labels` field.

The service sends final results when the audio stream is complete or in response to a timeout, whichever occurs first. The service sets the `final` field to `true` only for the last word of the speaker labels that it returns in either case.

### Performance considerations for speaker labels
{: #speakerLabelsPerformance}

As noted previously, the speaker labels feature is optimized for two-person conversations, such as communications with a call center. Therefore, you need to consider the following potential performance issues:

-   Performance for audio with a single speaker can be poor. Variations in audio quality or in the speaker's voice can cause the service to identify extra speakers who are not present. Such speakers are referred to as hallucinations.
-   Similarly, performance for audio with a dominant speaker, such as a podcast, can be poor. The service tends to miss speakers who talk for shorter amounts of time, and it can also produce hallucinations.
-   Performance for audio with more than six speakers is undefined. The feature can handle a maximum of six speakers.
-   Performance for short utterances can be less accurate than for long utterances. The service produces better results when participants speak for longer amounts of time, at least 30 seconds per speaker. The relative amount of audio that is available for each speaker can also affect performance.
-   Performance can degrade for the first 30 seconds of speech. It usually improves to a reasonable level after 1 minute of audio.

As with all transcription, performance can also be affected by poor audio quality, background noise, a person's manner of speech, overlapping speakers, and other aspects of the audio.

## Keyword spotting
{: #keyword_spotting}

The keyword spotting feature detects specified strings in a transcript. The service can spot the same keyword multiple times and report each occurrence. The service spots keywords only in the final results, not in interim results. By default, the service does no keyword spotting.

To use keyword spotting, you must specify both of the following parameters:

-   Use the `keywords` parameter to specify an array of strings to be spotted. The service spots no keywords if you omit the parameter or specify an empty array. A keyword string can include more than one token. For example, the keyword `Speech to Text` has three tokens.

    For US English, the service normalizes each keyword to match spoken versus written strings. For example, it normalizes numbers to match how they are spoken as opposed to written. For other languages, keywords must be specified as they are spoken.

    You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords with a single request. Keywords are case-insensitive.
-   Use the `keywords_threshold` parameter to specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0 for a keyword match. The threshold indicates the lower bound for the level of confidence the service must have for a word to match the keyword. A keyword is spotted in the transcript only if its confidence is greater than or equal to the specified threshold.

    Specifying a small threshold can potentially produce many matches. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. Omit the parameter to return no matches.

Keyword spotting is necessary to identify keywords in an audio stream. You cannot identify keywords by processing a final transcript because the transcript represents the service's best decoding results for the input audio. It does not include tokens with lower confidence scores that might represent a word of interest. So applying text processing tools to a transcript on the client side might not identify keywords. A richer representation of decoding results is needed, and that representation is available only at the server.

### Keyword spotting results
{: #keywordSpottingResults}

The service returns the results in a `keywords_result` field that is an element of the `results` array. The `keywords_result` field is a dictionary, or associative array, of enumerable properties. Each property is identified by a specified keyword and includes an array of objects. The service returns one element of the array for each match that it finds for the keyword. The object for each match includes the following fields:

-   `normalized_text` is the specified keyword that is normalized to the spoken phrase that matched in the input audio.
-   `start_time` is the start time in seconds of the match.
-   `end_time` is the end time in seconds of the match.
-   `confidence` is the service's confidence that the match represents the specified keyword. The confidence must be at least as great as the specified threshold to be included in the results.

A keyword for which the service finds no matches is omitted from the array. A keyword might not be found if

-   The audio simply does not include the keyword. Absence of the keyword is the most obvious explanation.
-   The threshold is set too high. The service might identify the keyword but with a lower level of confidence, in which case it omits the match from the results.
-   A keyword string that contains multiple tokens (for example, `Speech to Text`) is spoken with too much silence between its tokens. When the service transcribes audio, it chops the stream into a series of blocks. Each block represents a continuous chunk of audio that does not have an interval of silence that exceeds half of a second. It constructs an array of result objects that consists of these blocks.

    The service matches a multi-token keyword only if

    -   The keyword's tokens are in the same block.
    -   The tokens are either adjacent or separated by a gap of no more than 0.1 seconds.

    The latter case can occur if a brief filler or non-lexical utterance, such as "uhm" or "well," lies between two tokens of the keyword. For more information, see [Hesitation markers](/docs/services/speech-to-text-data?topic=speech-to-text-data-basic-response#hesitation).

### Keyword spotting example
{: #keywordSpottingExample}

The following example request sets the `keywords` parameter to a URL-encoded array of three strings (`colorado`, `tornado`, and `tornadoes`) and the `keywords_threshold` parameter to `0.5`. The service finds qualifying occurrences of `colorado` and `tornadoes`.

```bash
curl -X POST
--header "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
--header "Content-Type: audio/flac"
--data-binary @{path}audio-file.flac
"{url}/v1/recognize?keywords=%22colorado%22%2C%22tornado%22%2C%22tornadoes%22&keywords_threshold=0.5"
```
{: pre}

```javascript
{
  "results": [
    {
      "keywords_result": {
        "colorado": [
          {
            "normalized_text": "Colorado",
            "start_time": 4.94,
            "confidence": 0.91,
            "end_time": 5.62
          }
        ],
        "tornadoes": [
          {
            "normalized_text": "tornadoes",
            "start_time": 1.52,
            "confidence": 1.0,
            "end_time": 2.15
          }
        ]
      },
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "confidence": 0.96,
          "transcript": "several tornadoes touch down as a line of
severe thunderstorms swept through Colorado on Sunday "
        }
      ],
      "final": true
    }
  ],
  "result_index": 0
}
```
{: codeblock}

## Maximum alternatives
{: #max_alternatives}

The `max_alternatives` parameter accepts an integer value that tells the service to return the *n*-best alternative hypotheses for the results. By default, the service returns only a single transcription result, which is equivalent to setting the parameter to `1`. By setting `max_alternatives` to a number greater than 1, you ask the service to return that number of the best alternative transcriptions. (If you specify a value of `0`, the service uses the default value of `1`.)

The service reports a confidence score only for the best alternative that it returns. In most cases, that is the alternative to choose.

### Maximum alternatives example
{: #maximumAlternativesExample}

The following example request sets the `max_alternatives` parameter to `3`; the service reports a confidence for the most likely of the three alternatives.

```bash
curl -X POST
--header "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
--header "Content-Type: audio/flac"
--data-binary @{path}audio-file.flac
"{url}/v1/recognize?max_alternatives=3"
```
{: pre}

```javascript
{
  "results": [
    {
      "alternatives": [
        {
          "confidence": 0.96,
          "transcript": "several tornadoes touch down as a line of
severe thunderstorms swept through Colorado on Sunday "
        },
        {
          "transcript": "several tornadoes touched down as a line of
severe thunderstorms swept through Colorado on Sunday "
        },
        {
          "transcript": "several tornadoes touch down as a line of
severe thunderstorms swept through Colorado and Sunday "
        }
      ],
      "final": true
    }
  ],
  "result_index": 0
}
```
{: codeblock}

## Interim results
{: #interim}

The interim results feature is available only with the WebSocket interface.
{: note}

Interim results are intermediate hypotheses of a transcription that are likely to change before the service returns its final results. The service returns interim results as soon as it generates them. Interim results are useful for

-   Interactive applications and real-time transcription
-   Long audio streams, which can take a while to transcribe

Interim results arrive more often and more quickly than final results. You can use them to enable your application to respond more quickly or to gauge the progress of the transcription.

To receive interim results, set the `interim_results` JSON parameter to `true` in the `start` message for a WebSocket recognition request. If you omit the `interim_results` parameter or set it to `false`, the service returns only a single JSON transcript at the end of the audio. Follow these guidelines to use the parameter:

-   Omit the parameter or set it to `false` if you are doing offline or batch transcription, do not need minimum latency, and want a single JSON result for all audio.
-   Set the parameter to `true` if you want results to arrive progressively as the service processes the audio or if you want the results with minimum latency. Keep in mind that the service can update interim results as it processes more audio.

Interim results are indicated in the JSON response with the `final` field set to `false`. The service can update such results with more accurate transcriptions as it processes further audio. Final results are identified with the `final` field set to `true`. The service makes no further updates to final results.

### Interim results example
{: #interimResultsExample}

The following abbreviated example requests interim results for a WebSocket request. In its response, the service sets the `final` attribute to `true` only for the final result.

```javascript
var my_access_token = '{token}';
var wsURI = '{ws_url}/v1/recognize'
  + '?access_token=' + my_access_token;
var websocket = new WebSocket(wsURI);

websocket.onopen = function(evt) { onOpen(evt) };
function onOpen(evt) {
  var message = {
    action: 'start',
    content-type: 'audio/l16;rate=22050',
    interim_results: true
  };
  websocket.send(JSON.stringify(message));
  websocket.send(blob);
}

websocket.onmessage = function(evt) { onMessage(evt) };
function onMessage(evt) {
  console.log(evt.data);
}
```

## Word alternatives
{: #word_alternatives}

The word alternatives feature (also known as Confusion Networks) reports hypotheses for acoustically similar alternatives for words of the input audio. For instance, the word `Austin` might be the best hypothesis for a word from the audio. But the word `Boston` is another possible hypothesis in the same time interval. Hypotheses share a common start and end time but have different spellings and usually different confidence scores.

By default, the service does not report word alternatives. To indicate that you want to receive alternative hypotheses, you use the `word_alternatives_threshold` parameter to specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. The threshold indicates the lower bound for the level of confidence the service must have in a hypothesis to return it as a word alternative. A hypothesis is returned only if its confidence is greater than or equal to the specified threshold.

You can think of word alternatives as the timeline for a transcript that is chopped into smaller intervals, or bins. Each bin can have one or more hypotheses with different spellings and confidence. The `word_alternatives_threshold` parameter controls the density of the results that the service returns. Specifying a small threshold can potentially produce many hypotheses.

### Word alternatives results
{: #wordAlternativesResults}

The service returns the results in a `word_alternatives` field that is an element of the `results` array. The `word_alternatives` field is an array of objects, each of which provides the following fields for an alternative word:

-   `start_time` indicates the time in seconds at which the word for which hypotheses are returned starts in the input audio.
-   `end_time` indicates the time in seconds at which the word for which hypotheses are returned ends in the input audio.
-   `alternatives` is an array of hypothesis objects. Each object includes a `confidence` that indicates the service's confidence score for the hypothesis and a `word` that identifies the hypothesis. The confidence must be at least as great as the specified threshold to be included in the results. The service orders the alternatives by confidence.

### Word alternatives example
{: #wordAlternativesExample}

The following example request specifies a `word_alternatives_threshold` of `0.9`. The output includes potential hypotheses and confidence scores for a number of words, along with their start and end times.

```bash
curl -X POST
--header "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
--header "Content-Type: audio/flac"
--data-binary @{path}audio-file.flac

## Word confidence
{: #word_confidence}

The `word_confidence` parameter tells the service whether to provide confidence measures for the words of the transcript. By default, the service reports a confidence measure only for the final transcript as a whole. Setting `word_confidence` to `true` directs the service to report a confidence measure for each individual word of the transcript.

A confidence measure indicates the service's estimation that the transcribed word is correct based on the acoustic evidence. Confidence scores range from 0.0 to 1.0.

-   A score of 1.0 indicates that the current transcription of the word reflects the most likely result.
-   A score of 0.5 means that the word has a 50-percent chance of being correct.

### Word confidence example
{: #wordConfidenceExample}

The following example requests word confidence scores for the words of the transcription.

## Word timestamps
{: #word_timestamps}

The `timestamps` parameter tells the service whether to produce timestamps for the words it transcribes. By default, the service reports no timestamps. Setting `timestamps` to `true` directs the service to report the beginning and ending time in seconds for each word relative to the start of the audio.

### Word timestamps example
{: #wordTimestampsExample}

The following example requests timestamps for the words of the transcription.

```bash
curl -X POST
--header "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
--header "Content-Type: audio/flac"
--data-binary @{path}audio-file.flac
"{url}/v1/recognize?timestamps=true"

{: codeblock}

## Smart formatting
{: #smart_formatting}

The smart formatting feature is beta functionality that is available for US English, Japanese, and Spanish.
{: note}

The `smart_formatting` parameter directs the service to convert the following strings into more conventional representations:

-   Dates
-   Times
-   Series of digits and numbers
-   Phone numbers
-   Currency values
-   Internet email and web addresses

You set the `smart_formatting` parameter to `true` to enable smart formatting. By default, the service does not perform smart formatting.

The service applies smart formatting only to the final transcript of a recognition request. It applies smart formatting just before it returns the results to the client, when text normalization is complete. The conversion makes the transcript more readable and enables better post-processing of the transcription results.

### Punctuation (US English)
{: #smartFormattingPunctuation}

For US English, the feature also directs the service to substitute punctuation symbols for the following spoken keyword strings in the audio.

<table style="width:50%">
  <caption>Table 2. Smart formatting punctuation keywords</caption>
  <tr>
    <th style="width:45%; text-align:left">Keyword string</th>
    <th style="text-align:center">Resulting punctuation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Comma
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <code>,</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Period
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <code>.</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Question mark
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <code>?</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Exclamation point
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <code>!</code>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The service converts these keyword strings to symbols only in appropriate places. For example, the service converts the spoken phrase

```
the warranty period is short period
```
{: codeblock}

to the following text in a transcript

```
the warranty period is short.
```
{: codeblock}

### Language differences
{: #smartFormattingDifferences}

Smart formatting is based on the presence of obvious keywords in the transcript. The supported languages handle smart formatting slightly differently.

#### US English and Spanish
{: #smartFormattingEnglishSpanish}

-   Times are identified by keywords such as `AM`, `PM`, or `EST`.
-   Military times are converted if they are identified by the keyword `hours`.
-   Phone numbers must be either `911` or a number with 10 or 11 digits that starts with the number `1`.
-   In US English, dollar, cent, and euro values are replaced with their respective currency symbols.
-   In Spanish, dolar, peso, peseta, libras esterlinas, libra, and euro values are replaced with their respective currency symbols.

#### Japanese
{: #smartFormattingJapanese}

-   Internet email and web addresses are not converted.
-   Phone numbers must be 10 or 11 digits and begin with valid prefixes for telephone numbers in Japan. For example, valid prefixes include `03` and `090`.
-   English words are converted to ASCII (*hankaku*) characters. For example, <code>&#65321;&#65314;&#65325;</code> is converted to `IBM`.
-   Ambiguous terms might not be converted if sufficient context is unavailable. For example, it is unclear whether <code>&#19968;&#26178;</code> and <code>&#21313;&#20998;</code> refer to times.
-   Punctuation is handled in the same way with or without smart formatting. For example, based on probability calculations, one of <code>&#12459;&#12531;&#12510;</code> or `,` is selected.
-   Yen values are not replaced with the yen currency symbol.

### Smart formatting example
{: #smartFormattingExample}

The following example requests smart formatting with a recognition request by setting the `smart_formatting` parameter to `true`. The following sections show the effects of smart formatting on the results of a request.

### Example transcripts with long pauses
{: #smartFormattingLongPauses}

In cases where an utterance contains long enough silences, the service can split the transcript into two or more final chunks. This affects the results of the formatting, as shown in the following examples.

## Numeric redaction
{: #redaction}

The numeric redaction feature is beta functionality that is available for US English, Japanese, and Korean.
{: note}

The `redaction` parameter directs the service to redact, or mask, numeric data from final transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with an `X` character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers.

By default, the service does not redact numeric data. Set the `redaction` parameter to `true` to enable numeric redaction. When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly disable that feature. To ensure maximum security, the service also enforces the following parameter values when you enable redaction:

-   The service disables keyword spotting, regardless of whether you specify values for the `keywords` and `keywords_threshold` parameters.
-   The service disables interim results, regardless of whether you set the `interim_results` parameter of the WebSocket interface to `true`.
-   The service returns only a single, final transcript, regardless of whether you specify a value for the `maximum_alternatives` parameter.

The design of the feature parallels the existing smart formatting feature. The service applies redaction only to the final transcript of a recognition request, just before it returns the results to the client and after text normalization is complete.

Future versions of the feature might expand redaction to mask all telephone numbers, street addresses, bank accounts, social security numbers, and other sensitive numeric data.
{: note}

### Language differences
{: #redactionDifferences}

The feature works exactly as described for US English models but has the following differences for Japanese and Korean models.

#### Japanese
{: #redactionJapanese}

Japanese redaction has the following differences:

-   In addition to masking strings of three or more consecutive digits, redaction also masks street addresses and numbers, regardless of whether they contain fewer than three digits.
-   Similarly, redaction also masks date information in Japanese-style birth dates. In Japanese, date information is usually presented in Latin *Anno Domini* format but sometimes follows Japanese style, particularly for birth dates. In this case, the year and month are masked even though they contain just one or two digits. For example, numeric redaction changes the following string as shown.

    <table style="width:50%">
      <caption>Table 5. Example redaction of Japanese-style birth date</caption>
      <tr>
        <th style="text-align:left">Without redaction</th>
        <th style="text-align:left">With redaction</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          &#24179;&#25104; 30&#24180; 2&#26376;
        </td>
        <td>
          &#24179;&#25104; XX&#24180; X&#26376;
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

#### Korean
{: #redactionKorean}

Korean redaction has the following differences:

-   The smart formatting feature is not supported. The service still performs numeric redaction for Korean, but it performs no other smart formatting.
-   Isolated digit characters are reduced, but possible digit characters that are included as part of Korean phrases are not. For example, the character <code>&#51060;</code> in the following phrase is not replaced by an `X` because it is adjacent to the following character:

    <code>&#51060;&#51077;&#45768;&#45796;</code>

    If the <code>&#51060;</code> character were separated from the following character by a space, it would be replaced by an `X`, as described in [Numeric redaction results](#redactionResults).

### Numeric redaction example
{: #redactionExample}

The following example requests numeric redaction with a recognition request by setting the `redaction` parameter to `true`. Because the request enables redaction, the service implicitly enables smart formatting with the request. The service effectively disables the other parameters of the request so that they have no effect: The service returns a single final transcript and recognizes no keywords. The following section shows the effects of redaction.

```bash
curl -X POST
--header "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
--header "Content-Type: audio/wav"
--data-binary @{path}audio-file.wav
"{url}/v1/recognize?&redaction=true&max_alternatives=3&keywords=%22birth%22%2C%22birthday%22&keywords_threshold=0.5"

The `profanity_filter` parameter indicates whether the service is to censor profanity from its results. By default, the service obscures all profanity by replacing it with a series of asterisks in the transcript. Setting the parameter to `false` displays words in the output exactly as transcribed.

The service censors profanity from all final transcripts and from any alternative transcripts. It also censors profanity from results that are associated with word alternatives, word confidence, and word timestamps. The sole exception is keyword spotting, for which the service returns all words as specified by the user, regardless of whether `profanity_filter` is `true`.

### Profanity filtering example
{: #profanityFilteringExample}

The following example shows the results for a brief audio file that is transcribed with the default `true` value for the `profanity_filter` parameter. The request also sets the `word_alternatives_threshold` parameter to a relatively high value of `0.99` and the `word_confidence` and `timestamps` parameters to `true`.

```bash
curl -X POST
--header "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
--header "Content-Type: audio/flac"
--data-binary @{path}audio-file.flac
"{url}/v1/recognize?word_alternatives_threshold=0.99&word_confidence=true&timestamps=true"
```
